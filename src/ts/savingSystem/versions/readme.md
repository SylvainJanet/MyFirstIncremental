# a.b.c

# c : different implementations : same object(s) saved on same location(s) on localStorage. Implementation may differ

# for instance, JSON, XML, or any other datastructure may change

# data may be modified in final version (error correction, base64 transform, add other info such as timestamp,...)

# b : different interfaces : the objects saved are modified, but the location(s) on localStorage remains the same

# for instance, a new value may be added (corresponding to a new feature in game)

# a : major changes that requires a substantial change in management

# for instance, a new location may be used in localStorage

# the code structure of the saving system may change
